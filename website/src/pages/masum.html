                            I found my passion in programming during my high school days. Started a formal career as a
                            Systems Administrator and Developer in leading ISP of the day, Agni Systems Ltd. in 1999.
                            Designed and implemented one of the largest pre-paid billing systems for dial-up subscribers
                            and helped Agni to become one of the largest dial-up ISPs with multiple POPs in the country.

                            With Tanveer Hasan and Mushtaque Ahmed, we founded DSi in 2001 focusing on doing high end
                            software development projects for a world wide clientele. Joined Therap Services in 2004. As
                            its lead developer and later on CTO, I helped the company to grow from its pilot to phase
                            until it became a national leader in its niche segment in the health sector in USA.

                            With my experience and natural abilities, my primary strengths have become developing large
                            and scalable systems and building the right teams that can build such systems.

                            After a successful career at Therap Services, I joined a Y-Combinator funded startup,
                            Backpack Technologies. Helped to stabilize their back-end and scale it.
