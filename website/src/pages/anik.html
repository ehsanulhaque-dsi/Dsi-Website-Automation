                            I have been in the software industry for over 10 years. Having started my career as a
                            software developer in 2006, I worked in several key positions at DSi like software
                            developer, senior software developer, team lead and system analyst. I have a long term
                            experience of working with different levels of actors in the overall software development
                            life cycle.

                        <p>
                            In my role as Senior Software Engineer, I had the
                            chance to work with clients to identify requirements and provide cost analysis, designers to
                            assist with creating user friendly interfaces, developers to develop implementation
                            timeliness and testers to develop test cases and test plans.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As a team lead and senior developer I had the opportunity of developing systems with a Java
                            EE platform with Spring framework and SQL Server as backend database. In 2013, I started
                            working with Jenzabar and closely worked with their Higher Reach product. The system is
                            developed on Java EE platform with Java Struts, EJB, Custom Java Swing framework. This
                            system supports databases like: Oracle, SQL Server and MySQL. Almost 800+ Universities all
                            over USA currently use Higher Reach as their core system.
