        <p>ODMS has been in operation for over 12 years. Currently a total of 3 engineers are part of the team. The
            development phase has taken up a few years and once it was up and running DSi is giving full support and
            maintenance. </p>

        <p>The idea of this solution is to simplify the export import system where containers and cargo can easily be
            tracked and maintained. We have configured the server provided them the clients with a complete management
            system. The major requirements for such a system is the continuity of service i.e. the production needs to
            be live at all times and DSi has been providing that for many years now. Data accuracy is another major
            element that needs to be focused on when dealing with such businesses. Another factor required is the
            monitoring of overall activity so that at any point the statistical report of a specific time frame can be
            given. These are required by cargo and container related businesses in order to plan in advance and analyze
            the department wise performance of the business. </p>

        <p>It is expected from DSi to give a complete support solution starting from software support to hardware
            support and also operational support. This has been done by going to the site and ensuring the system is up
            to the mark. </p>

        <p>An important added service is the billing where all of the payments coming in or going out of the system is
            tracked and saved. There are separate billing modules for the depot owner and using those the clients can
            get statistical reports that they can use for future reference. </p>

        <p>As a team during development the members of ODMS worked relentlessly on site and off site to ensure the
            system was online in a short time and met all the requirements of an efficient cargo and container
            management system. Currently the team is mainly focusing on a complete 24 hour support and maintenance
            system. The clients can call or inform at anytime about any help required. Once the team completes the work,
            it is tested and approved by the software quality assurance engineer. Finally the clients are informed about
            the task being completed. </p>
