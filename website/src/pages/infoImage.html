        <hr>

        <p>The journey of DSi as the developing partner of the company related to different types financial institution
            softwares started 5 years ago when the team comprised of only two developers. Over the span of years the
            team has grown and currently there are 32 team members from DSi working as the offshore team. </p>

        <p>Initially the team helped with minor projects and now they have ownership of a number of projects which they
            have built from scratch. The complete team is made of a number of developers, business analysts and quality
            assurance testers. There are multiple projects that need to be handled by each team and they all need to be
            integrated as some of the projects are correlated and codependent. Thus teamwork plays a major role in this
            process. The growth of the team and the professional bond built with the client over the years is a great
            achievement. </p>

        <p>It is a powerful technology that integrates everything - account holder statements, check images, daily
            notices, taxable income/interest forms and customized, targeted marketing - from data conversion and digital
            printing, to automated inserting, pre-sorting, mailing and electronic presentment and archival. The client
            has over 140 financial institutions as their clients including small banks, credit unions and other
            financial companies. </p>

        </h3>
        <hr>

        <p>Both the onshore and the offshore team work in seamless and simple yet effective way. They follow sprints
            every two weeks. As the team comprises of multiple projects and each one has their own team lead, the timing
            of the sprints may vary but the overall system that they follow is the same. Scrums are held after initial
            meetings with the onshore team and once the development work is divided and completed the feedback is taken
            from the clients and final touch up is done before the release. </p>

        <p>A team usually has four members with a developer lead handling a project. Similar projects are maintained by
            one team lead who is in charge of keeping constant communication with the onshore team and keeping them up
            to date. </p>

            <small class="primary-color">Development Process</small>
        </h3>
        <hr>

        <p>The process starts with the onshore team turning over a project to DSi. Once the project is assigned the
            Redmine tickets are assigned by the lead who acts as the scrum master. An estimation is also given by
            looking into the details of the mockups, scope of work and the data. Once the resource planning is done and
            the onshore team is consulted a detailed requirements document is created to help the developing process.
            Weekly scrum meetings help with the discussion between the analysts, developers and QA engineers to
            successfully go through the entire process until the final code deployment. </p>

        <p>Throughout the development process, starting from the development environment through the staging environment
            and up until the pilot environment, the clients are directly kept in the loop. Each of these stages go
            through different modes of testing such as load testing and regression testing. All the bugs are fixed,
            tested and approved. The final code is deployed only after the final feedback from the clients is received.
            The aim is to provide a satisfactory result with which both the teams are happy. </p>
