                            <p>I have been in the business of helping clients succeed with software development and IT
                                solutions throughout my career. I joined DSi in 2012 as a Software Developer. Since then
                                I've had the opportunity to work with MongoDb, Apache Derby, PostgreSQL, Restify, Monk,
                                AngularJS, Spring MVC, Vaadin and various other technologies. </p>

                            <p>My main interest is to understand how to design software systems, so as to maximize the
                                productivity of development teams. In doing this I can understand the patterns of good
                                software design, and also the processes that support software design. I find it best to
                                learn a lot from listening to the experiences of my fellow Innovators. Part of my
                                journey is tied to development and encouraging teamwork and leadership, and I am
                                constantly excited, amazed and captivated by working with different types of people as
                                well as different types of technologies. </p>
